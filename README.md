# Vaultkeeper for Obsidian

> *Note 1:* This plugin is being vibe coded. So, if you are not wanting AI code in your vault, please do not use this plugin. Though I am a full time Full Stack Developer so I can validate none of the code is leaking secrets or collecting personal data if that helps you.

> *Note 2:* I am making this plugin for myself. While I accept feature requests, I may not complete them as this plugin is for me, I offer it to anyone in case your brain works like mine. I do not guarantee any support or updates.

A comprehensive Obsidian plugin that organizes and manages attachments, renames pasted files automatically, and extracts text from images and PDFs using OCR — all within your vault.

## 🚀 Features

### 📁 Attachment Organization
- **Flexible destination**: Move attachments using Obsidian's built-in setting, same folder as the linking note, or a separate named folder
- **Subfolder sorting**: Sort into subfolders by date, file type, or a custom pattern using tokens like `{{year}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{type}}`, `{{filename}}`
- **Configurable extensions**: Define exactly which file types count as attachments
- **Ignore rules**: Skip specified folders during organizing or purging
- **Empty folder cleanup**: Folders left empty after organizing are automatically deleted
- **Auto-organize**: Run on startup and/or on a repeating interval

### ✏️ Paste Rename
- Automatically rename files when pasted or dropped into a note
- **Five modes**: do nothing, date-based, custom pattern, ask each time, or date pre-filled + ask to confirm
- **Tokens**: `{{year}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{type}}`, `{{filename}}` (active note name), `{{original}}` (pasted file's original name)
- Embed links in the note are updated automatically to match the new filename

### 🧹 Attachment Cleanup
- **Find Unlinked Attachments**: Identify attachment files not linked from any note
- **Purge Unlinked Attachments**: Safely delete unlinked attachments — select all, none, or individual files via checkboxes, then confirm before anything is deleted

### 🔍 OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Powered by **Google Gemini AI**
- Extract text from images (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP, BMP, GIF, HEIC, HEIF) and PDFs
- Auto-process new files added to a watch folder
- Auto-update OCR notes when source files are modified
- Process files in batches with rate-limit handling and exponential backoff
- Fully customizable prompt and output note template
- Pick any individual file to OCR via command palette

## 📘 Usage

### 🔄 Organizing Attachments

1. Open **Settings > Attachment Organizer > Organization Settings**
2. Set your **Destination**:
   - *Use Obsidian settings* — respects your vault's "Default location for new attachments" setting
   - *Same location as file* — moves attachments to the same folder as the note that links to them
   - *Separate folder* — uses a configured folder name (e.g. `attachments`)
3. Optionally choose **Sort into subfolders by** (none, date, file type, or custom pattern)
4. Run **"Organize attachments"** from the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`)

### ✏️ Paste Rename

1. Open **Settings > Attachment Organizer > Paste Rename Settings**
2. Choose a **Rename mode**:
   - *Do not rename* — default, no change
   - *Date-based* — auto-rename using a date pattern (e.g. `2026-05-04.png`)
   - *Custom pattern* — auto-rename using any token combination
   - *Ask each time* — a prompt appears after each paste so you can type the name
   - *Date-based + ask to confirm* — prompt pre-filled with the date pattern
3. Configure the pattern using tokens: `{{year}}`, `{{month}}`, `{{day}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{type}}`, `{{filename}}` (note name), `{{original}}` (pasted file's original name)

### 🗑 Purging Unlinked Attachments

1. Run **"Purge unlinked attachments"** from the Command Palette
2. A modal lists all unlinked attachments with checkboxes (all selected by default)
3. Use **Select All** / **Select None** to bulk-toggle, or check/uncheck individual files
4. Click **Delete Selected** → review the confirmation list → click **Delete** to permanently remove, or **← Back** to revise
5. Click **Cancel** at any point to abort
